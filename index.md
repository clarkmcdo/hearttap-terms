## 7. Reporting and Blocking

### Content Moderation

We actively monitor and filter inappropriate content using automated systems. Messages containing hate speech, threats, or harassment are automatically blocked from being sent. Our content filter uses pattern matching and keyword detection to identify and prevent harmful content before it reaches recipients.

### Reporting Inappropriate Content

You can report messages that violate our Terms of Service by long-pressing on any message in your Love History and selecting "Report Message." When you submit a report, we collect:

- The content of the message being reported

- Any additional details you choose to provide
- Your user ID and the reported user's ID
- Timestamp of the report

All reports are reviewed by our moderation team within 24 hours of submission. We take all reports seriously and will take appropriate action based on the severity of the violation, which may include:

- Sending a warning to the reported user
- Temporarily suspending the user's account
